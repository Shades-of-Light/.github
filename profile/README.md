## Starting Small
Shades of Light started from humble beginnings in 1986 as a small, single location showroom in historic Richmond, Virginia selling unique, high-style lighting designs. Since that time, the company has grown to become a national, multi-channel retailer of lighting and other home decor products. True to its heritage though, the company has remained singularly focused on its curated collection of high-style products and unique lighting designs, many of which are produced in Virginia by the companyâ€™s own staff of highly trained artisans.
